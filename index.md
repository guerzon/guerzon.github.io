Welcome to my blog! My name is Lester, a server/platform engineer well-versed in CentOS/RHEL systems administration, Amazon AWS, Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform, server security, configuration management with Ansible, and Docker and Kubernetes. Quite recently I have been digging deeper into Kubernetes (GKE), Google Cloud Platform, and observability tooling.

I used to write about offensive security here, but going forward I will write more about site reliability engineering, IaC, and cloud tech.

When I'm not infront of the computer, I am either learning languages (currently Spanish and German), cycling somewhere in Bavaria, working out at the gym, or reading books.

Enjoy reading!
