Welcome to my blog! My name is Lester, a platform engineer currently focused on Linux systems administration, configuration management (with Ansible), Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), AWS and Kubernetes administration. I am particularly interested in automating manual and repetitive tasks and improving systems security.

I used to write about offensive security here, but going forward I will write more about Site Reliability engineering, IaC and configuration management.

When I'm not infront of the computer, I am either learning languages (currently Spanish and German), cycling somewhere in Bavaria, working out at the gym, or reading books.

See you around!
