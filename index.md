Welcome to my blog!

My name is Lester, a server systems engineer passionate about Linux internals, public cloud, Kubernetes, OSS, Golang, and cybersecurity. I (re)started this blog because I realized that writing about things I care about is really fun and challenging.

I hope this blog reaches those who share the same interests as mine! Enjoy reading!
