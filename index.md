<p>Hi! My name is Lester! I see you have found my website.. I hope for good reasons! Feel free to check around - there is nothing groundbreaking here if you're a cybersec pro, but hopefully you will get an idea on what I am currently up to!</p>

- I'm currently working on my OSCP and am planning to take the exam on the 5th week of 2022. Follow my progress [here](/oscp-progress).

- I recently joined in the [#365daysofhacking](/365daysofhacking) challenge, where I try to learn something new or perform a security task for 365 days.
