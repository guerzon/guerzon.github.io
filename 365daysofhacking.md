Welcome to my journal for my #365daysofhacking journey, a trend in the infosec community where one tries to learn something new or perform a security task for 365 days.

- Day: 1
  - [Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) back-to-basics
- Day: 2
  - Hydra and brute-forcing authentication mechanisms
  - Finally moved all my infosec notes to markdown!
- Day: 3

  - Insighful THREAT CON 2019 [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEzBnzhluHY) by [Mario Heiderich](https://cure53.de/) titled "XSS is dead?"
    - Interesting history of XSS
    - Overwhelmingly huge scope of the bug class
    - Previous and ongoing work, tools, and projects to protect against XSS
    - Definitely agree on the point that people who apply patches and fixes against vulnerabilities should be recognized too!
