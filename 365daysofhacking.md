Welcome to my journal for my #365daysofhacking journey.

- Day: 1 - [Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) back-to-basics
- Day: 2
    - Hydra and brute-forcing authentication mechanisms
    - Finally moved all my infosec notes to markdown!
- Day: 3
    - Review: OWASP Top 10 [7/10]
    - Started reading some interesting papers from the [Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcp)
- Day: 4 -  Review: [OWASP Top 10](https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop10) [10/10]
- Day: 5 - [Cross-site Scripting](https://tryhackme.com/room/xss) - strong favorite from the OWASP Top 10
- Day: 6 - [BountyHunter](https://www.hackthebox.eu/achievement/machine/429896/359) (Easy HackTheBox machine):
  - First XXE exploitation
  - Python code review
- Day: 7 -  Redeployed my website [pidnull.io](https://pidnull.io) - this time with Jekyll and GitHub Pages! Markdown FTW!
- Day: 8 - Wazuh - Agent rollout via Ansible done! CentOS and Debian agents tested. I'm starting to enjoy exploring SIEM!
- Day: 9 - Insighful THREAT CON 2019 [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEzBnzhluHY) by [Mario Heiderich](https://cure53.de/) titled "XSS is dead?"
  - Interesting history of XSS
  - Overwhelmingly huge scope of the bug class
  - Previous and ongoing work, tools, and projects to protect against XSS
  - Definitely agree on the point that people who apply patches and fixes against vulnerabilities should be recognized too!
